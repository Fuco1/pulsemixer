# PulseMixer

An experiment with Haskell FFI.

I'm trying to create:

* the most basic and useful bindings for PulseAudio
* an interface like `alsamixer` to change channel volume

That's all.  A project going for complete bindings can be found here: https://github.com/favonia/pulse/.  However, it seems mostly dead.
